# Average Task Value EEG Study

Participants completed three learning tasks. In each task the goal was to attempt to learn cue-response mappings for six stimuli. The possible responses were left ('d' key) or right ('k' key). There were two types of cues. Low-value cues had a feedback validity of 0.5 (outcome was a coin toss no matter the action). High-value cues had a feedback validity of 0.8 (80% chance of a win if the correct action is chosen). The low-value task contained only low-value cues. The high-value task contained only high-value cues. The mid-value task contained three low-value cues and three high-value cues. Participants completed 144 trials of each task.
